## Our goals

Our mission is to enable widespread AI assistants that can make data-driven decisions based on your personal data.
To do this, we need to build the infrastructure to export data from all platforms, and bring it together in a way that is accessible and easy to use.
While we don't focus on building AI assistants themselves, we do focus on making personal data more accessible.

## How we can help

We can help you build the infrastructure to export your data from your platform.
We can also help you build the infrastructure to ingest that data into your platform.
