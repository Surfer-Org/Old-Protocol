  <Step title="Takeout (unfortunately) gives you your Gmail data in an MBOX format, which is not very user friendly.">
    You can use these MBOX to JSON converters:
    - [Python](https://github.com/PS1607/mbox-to-json)
    - [Node.js](https://github.com/d4data-official/mbox-to-json)
    <Info>
      A [GitHub issue](https://github.com/Surfer-Protocol/Protocol/issues/3) has been opened to build a no-code solution for this where you can upload your MBOX file and get a JSON export.
