## How it works

Surfer Protocol aims to document the process of getting back your personal data from different platforms.

## Why?

We've been building chatbots, agents, and assistants for over a year now and one thing we've realized is that these AIs are only as personalized to you as the data they have access to. While LLMs have essentially been democratized, getting your personal data from the platforms you use is still annoying despite laws such as the GDPR and CCPA that require companies to provide you with your data.

This August, we built an [open-source Desktop App called Surfer Data](https://github.com/CEREBRUS-MAXIMUS/Surfer-Data) that allows you to export your data easily from the different platforms you use, such as YouTube, GitHub, Notion, Twitter, and LinkedIn.

The issue with this is that it was difficult to get other people to build off of this, which was one of our goals when we began building Surfer Data. That's why we're building Surfer Protocol, an open-source protocol that allows you to document the process of getting your data from any platform.

Later, we plan on adding a data exporter, knowledge graph visualizer, chatting with data, and more! We also plan on making it super easy for developers to build off of Surfer Protocol and build their own applications.

## How can I contribute?

We're always looking for ways to improve Surfer Protocol and make it more useful for everyone. If you have any ideas, please let us know by opening an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/Surfer-Protocol/Protocol/issues) or by joining our [Discord](https://discord.gg/Tjg7pjcFNP).

To add a platform, please follow the instructions in the [Adding Platforms](/platforms/adding/platforms) guide.
