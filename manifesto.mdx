## The Critical Problem

Your personal data is trapped in data lakes across hundreds of platforms. Everything from your heart rate, calendar events, or LinkedIn network is trapped in different silos. While AI models, agent architecture, and LLM prompting will continuously improve, to truly build useful personalized AGI, we need build tools to consolidate this personal data. We've attempted to build these tools in the past, but the undertaking of such a massive effort has caused us - and many before us - to eventually abandon the efforts. 
 Surfer Protocol documents the data formats and export processes of hundreds of platforms to enable developers to understand the scope of possibilty of building applications that use personal data.

## Our Story

[Sahil Lalani](https://x.com/SahilLalani0) and [Jack Blair](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jackblair876/) are lifelong quantified selfers - people who track everything about themselves to better understand their minds and build products to improve their lives. 

Over the past few years, we've built [autonomous web browsers](https://x.com/JackBlair87/status/1816661898663952404), [AI Agents](https://x.com/cjarrayadev/status/1804932665684238724), and [digital clones](https://x.com/JackBlair87/status/1812249606010658840). 

While these novel experiments have been fun, we've realized that the largest benefit to these technologies come from the ability to use highly grounded personal data.

While LLMs, agents, and prompting have essentially become free and democratized, bringing your personal data from the platforms you use continues to be the limiting factor, despite laws such as the GDPR and CCPA that require companies to provide you with that data.

To combat this, in August, we built an [open-source Desktop App called Surfer Data](https://github.com/CEREBRUS-MAXIMUS/Surfer-Data) that allows you to export your data easily from the different platforms you use, such as YouTube, GitHub, Notion, Twitter, and LinkedIn.

Surfer Data automated the process of clicking the export buttons, but we now realize that the real limiting factor is the data knowledge and post-processing itself.

Now, we're taking taking a step back and building Surfer Protocol, an open-source protocol that documents the data formats of these same platforms.

True data portability will be a multi-decade problem. Our larger goal is to develop and ecosystem of tools for hobbyists and developers that allow for the easy portability of this information to modern AI architectures. This includes a knowledge graph visualizer, chatting with data, and more! We also plan on making it super easy for developers to build off of Surfer Protocol and build their own applications.

## How can I contribute?

We're always looking for ways to improve Surfer Protocol and make it more useful for everyone. If you have any ideas, please let us know by opening an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/Surfer-Protocol/Protocol/issues) or by joining our [Discord](https://discord.gg/Tjg7pjcFNP).
